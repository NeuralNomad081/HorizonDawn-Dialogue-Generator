Now, I didn't always understand her - on account of all that speaking in tongues and such - but when she did use her words, it was always End Times-this and Lake of Fire-that, on account of sinful lifestyles. Speaking of which - mind if I smoke?"

Been plenty of snakesters chasing the bounty, too, but I kept the zigging to their zag. How'd you finger me?"
