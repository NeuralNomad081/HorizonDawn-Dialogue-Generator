Director Evans invited everyone to gather in the community room. Don't know where she got the party hats. That was a ghoulish touch. So there we sit, watching the clock tick down to midnight, and I'm thinking, am I the only one here who gets the symbolism of this? Might've been worth it if Skylar had gotten drunk again, but... I seem to be a mistake she doesn't want to repeat."
