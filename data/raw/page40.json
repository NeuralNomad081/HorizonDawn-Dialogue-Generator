Remember the Odyssey - that multi-national heap of space junk that's been in graveyard orbit since '57? That went nowhere, real slow, and you have to get somewhere - real fast. Do you have any idea the immensity of the challenge, to prep a new colony ship in time?"

It's the first thing you'd abandon in favor of embryonics. For that kind of storage we're talking a lot of bulk, a lot of power, a lot of resources - so even if you do it, even if you build it and point it at Sirius X, there's no room for people on that thing, all right!?"
