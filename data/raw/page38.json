I still dream about it, after all these years. The Red Zone spreading on the imaging, slowly, so slowly, like a hand opening its fingers."

            "Susanne Alpert": "Really? That's interesting. Because... nothing worked. Nothing could grow there again. It was a catastrophic failure. But the Red Zone is a blip compared to global-scale biomass reduction. The biosphere and hydrosphere will collapse, render the Earth uninhabitable, long before the robots finish us. Enduring Victory can't buy time against that... So you'd better show me what Zero Dawn really is."
