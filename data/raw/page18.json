The swarm came in from the Pacific, and-I don't know if it was the local minutemen or the Crazy 15th, but they'd set the garbage patch alight. Man, the sea was on fire, that stuff was-the first wave of bots came in covered in burning sludge. That bought us an hour or two of slaughtering them on the beaches before the swarm recalculated. We pulled them inland, back through the Cal-Mar sprawl. Dropped buildings on them, EMP'd the grid... standard operating procedure. (sigh) The last time I was in California... I was... five? Six? Light like that vintage social net filter that was everywhere in the '40s."
