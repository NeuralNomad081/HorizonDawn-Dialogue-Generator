But they have to understand what you did for them. How you loved the whole world, so much. With an intensity that was... dazzling. Bruising. And in the end, it killed you. Or you died for it. Different perspectives. No-one could keep up with you. Live up to you. I don't know, maybe if I hadn't taken that postdoc in Joburg... I'm glad you shot down the Lightkeeper protocol, in the end. I don't think I could've taken seeing another one of you. I mean... Elisabet Sobeck? There's only one. I miss you."
